# Nervessel
An anatomy learning resource to understand the courses and branches of the blood vessels and nerves of the human body. 
Lets face it...learning anatomy is hard.
Imagine swimming or moving through the blood vessels of the human body and seeing various exit points, roundabouts (anterior circumflex humeral artery, im looking at you)
Building up a map of the arteries, veins, and nerves of the human body allows us to contextualise this information about the course of these blood vessels and nerves.
This is a much easier way of learning. We are accustomed to looking at directions via google maps and not by following them through the human body.
Imagine making a google maps version of the arteries of the body, but in 3D. Imagine walking around the aortic arch and then turning left at the left subclavian artery, after passing the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery.
This is where Nervessel comes in. My goal is to make learning anatomy of the vessels and nerves much easier for medical students and anyone else interested in human anatomy.
